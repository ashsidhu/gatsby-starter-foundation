*If you are not armed well, the Himalayas will chew you up and spit you out. And I was armed with a blunt knife against an army of snipers.*

From my city down in the plains, I decided to travel for a few days in the mountains. The plan was to find as much dirt routes as possible. But, (and I feel like a clueless foreigner admitting this) I totally underestimated India's population. The southern part of the mountains is really really densely populated. There are no off-road routes or empty spaces. Everything is taken up by humans or tarmac.

Luckily, my friends from Bangalore recommended some routes further north.
